        <p>This page covers the technical aspects of this website — its overall structure, style explanations, graphic
          design aspects, and further discussions.</p>

        <h3><span class="text-accent">Overall Structure</span></h3>
        <p>The website consists of 7 key items under the <code>websystems/</code> directory:</p>

        <table class="structure-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Filename</th>

        </table>
        <p>Each page is mostly comprised of boilerplate HTML to define the header and footer and their contents.</p>

        <p>The header is comprised of the website's title and a series of anchors (styled as buttons) to navigate
          between the pages, while the footer includes some additional information as well as a sitemap.</p>

        <p>The reason why each page has both a navbar and a sitemap is to provide navigation controls on both the top
          and bottom of the page, minimising the need to scroll in some cases.</p>

        <h3><span class="text-accent">Internal Structure</span></h3>
        <h4>Wrappers</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><code>div#main-wrapper</code>: Serves as a container for the <b>entire page</b>.</li>
          <li><code>div#content-wrapper</code>: Serves as a container for the <b>header</b>, <b>main content</b> and
            <b>footer</b>.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>A <code>hr</code> element is placed after <code>#content-wrapper</code> to mark the end of the header and the
          start of the main content.</p>

        <h4>Header</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><code>h1</code>: The title of the page - <em>WebSys Assignment</em>.</li>
          <li><code>nav</code> and <code>nav a.btn</code>: A navbar with links to all the pages.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Main Content</h4>
        <p>The main content of the page, such as <code>p</code> and heading elements are stored in a single
          container, <code>main#content</code>. The <code>main</code> element is a semantic HTML element that indicates
          where the main content of the page is stored. Using it was appropriate for this case.</p>

        <h4>Footer</h4>
        <ol>
          <li><code>div.footer-content</code>: Contains two divs displayed in a flexbox row layout, which include the
            course number and sitemap.</li>
          <li><code>p</code>: Holds the copyright disclaimer.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Like the space between the header and the main content, the children of the footer are also divided by a
          <code>hr</code> element.
        </p>

        <h3><span class="text-accent">CSS Classes</span></h3>
        <p>This section will provide a brief outline of the CSS classes that were used.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><code>btn</code>: Styles elements that perform an action, e.g. buttons.</li>
          <li><code>bg-primary, bg-secondary, etc</code>: Primarily used to demonstrate the colour scheme within
            <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> elements.
          </li>
          <li><code>border-codelike</code>: Apply a style like that of a <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element.</li>
          <li><code>nowrap</code>: Prevent an element's text from wrapping in a way that breaks words. Used in table
            cells to ensure code examples aren't broken.</li>
          <li><code>active-page</code>: Applied to the button which is used to navigate to the page the user is
            currently viewing.</li>
          <li><code>sitemap</code>: Style the sitemap element.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3><span class="text-accent">CSS Styles</span></h3>
        <p>This section covers some of the more complex style properties, beyond self explanatory ones like
          <code>color</code>. Each style is first explained in detail, followed by a brief look at how specific values
          were applied in the website’s design.
        </p>
        <table class="style-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>
              <th scope="col">Name</th>
              <th scope="col">Explanation</th>
            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><code>box-sizing</code></td>
              <td>The <code>box-sizing</code> property comes with two options, <code>content-box</code> (the default)
                and <code>border-box</code>, which was used for this page.<br><br>Content box sizing interprets the
                padding and
                border of an element to add on to its defined width, whereas border box sizing intrinsically includes
                the padding and border of an element to fit within its defined width. The <code>border-box</code> sizing
                property is far more intuitive than its counterpart which is why it was used.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>display</code></td>
              <td>The <code>display</code> property outlines how an element should be rendered in the DOM. For this
                website, the <code>flex</code> value was primarily used. The <code>inline</code> value was also used a
                single time.<br><br>The flexbox layout allows elements to be arranged by columns or rows,
                and is very flexible when it comes to positioning elements and defining their proportions. This
                page uses a flexbox display within the header and the footer, as well as the content wrapper.<br><br>The
                inline layout makes elements behave like text. This was used in the footer sitemap to force all list
                items containing the anchor elements into a single line.
              </td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>justify-content</code></td>
              <td><code>justify-content</code> controls how the space in between flex items is distributed along the
                primary axis of a flex container. The site used various different values for this
                style.<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <code>space-between</code>: Evenly distributes the space between items, while ensuring
                    that the first and last item are aligned with the starting and finishing edges. It is used in
                    <code>.footer-content</code> to position the course number section opposite the sitemap.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <code>space-evenly</code>: Ensures the space between and around the items is equal, providing the
                    most uniform distribution out of all the values for <code>justify-content</code>. It is used in
                    <code>header</code> to distribute the heading and navbar.
                  </li>
                  <li><code>center</code>: Pushes all items flushly together into the center of the flex container. It
                    is utilised in the <code>nav</code> to center the nav once the <code>flex-direction</code> of the
                    parent container switches to <code>column</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                It is important to note that this property has a "sibling", which is <code>align-content</code>. The
                difference between them is that <code>justify-content</code> affects distribution in the direction of
                the main axis (set to <code>row</code> by default), while <code>align-content</code> affects item
                distribution in the direction of the cross-axis (meaning single row/single column flex containers are
                unaffected by <code>align-content</code>).

            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td><code>padding</code></td>
              <td>Padding is the distance between an element's content and its border. Almost every element, including
                this very paragraph, has padding.</td>

              <td>The border is what wraps around a padded element. It essentially sits in between the padding and
                margin of an element. This site frequently uses borders, like those around buttons,
                <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> elements, tables, and the header/footer.

        <h3><span class="text-accent">CSS Combinators</span></h3>
        <p>This section outlines some of the CSS combinators that were used when styling content. A combinator is used
          to combine selectors in a way that allows elements to be selected based on their location relative to other
          elements.</p>
        <table class="selector-table">
          <thead>
            <tr>

            </tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td>Selector list</td>
              <td>A comma separated list of selectors that, allowing you to select multiple elements to apply the same
                styles to. This combination method was used frequently throughout the website.</td>
              <td><code>h1, h2, h3</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Descendant combinator</td>
              <td>The descendant combinator (denoted by a space) combines two selectors in a way that requires the first
                selector to be a parent (direct or indirect) of the second selector. This is another combinator that was
                used often throughout the CSS, in places such as <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements on
                <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements nested within different containers.
              </td>
              <td><code>.sitemap li</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Child combinator</td>
              <td>The child combinator (<code>&gt;</code>) is used to select an element that is an immediate descendant
                of the first element. It was used in the website to style all elements inside the table header row
                element (of specificity <code>table thead tr</code>).</td>
              <td><code>#id div &gt; h1</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Subsequent-sibling combinator</td>
              <td>The subsequent-sibling combinator (<code>~</code>) allows you to select all elements that are preceded
                by a certain element. The website utilises this combinator to apply margins to headers if they are
                preceded by content, using these selectors: <code>#content * ~ h1, * ~ h2, ...</code>, which selects
                header elements that are preceded by any element (<code>*</code>). If a header is not preceded by
                anything, it means that is it at the beginning of the <code>#content</code> div, and should not have any
                top margins.</td>
              <td><code>h1 ~ p</code></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Next-sibling combinator</td>
              <td>The next-sibling combinator (<code>+</code>) selects all the elements that follow a certain element.
                It was used in the website's footer to italicize the first paragraph that followed a
                <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> (the course identification).
              </td>
              <td><code>h3 + p</code></td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
        <h3><span class="text-accent">Graphic Design Aspects</span></h3>
        <h4>Colouring</h4>
        <p>Due to the lack of variation in website content, with the only diversity coming from buttons and text
          elements that carry more importance than just regular paragraphs, an extremely simple colour palette was
          formulated. It consists of <span class="border-codelike bg-primary">three</span> <span
            class="border-codelike bg-secondary">consecutively</span> <span
            class="border-codelike bg-tertiary">darker</span> shades of
          white for primary colouring, as well as
          <span class="border-codelike bg-table-alt">additional shade</span> for alternate table rows, and <span
            class="border-codelike bg-accent">three</span>
          <span class="border-codelike bg-link">consecutively</span> <span
            class="border-codelike bg-link-visited text-white">darker</span> orange accent shades for elements
          such as headings (relating to primary discussions), links, focused elements, and selected elements.
        </p>
        <h4>Typefaces</h4>
        <p>This website uses three typefaces of <strong>Inter</strong> (<b>bold</b>, normal, and <i>italic</i>), an open
          source free
          sans-serif font
          that emphasises high readability and aesthetics. If the user's browser does not support Inter, two fallback
          fonts were provided to the <code>font-family</code> property: <code class="font-arial">Arial</code>, and <code
            class="font-sans-serif">sans-serif</code> (sans-serif in this
          context instructs CSS to find the operating system's default sans-serif font).
        </p>
        <h4>Layout</h4>
        <p>Various layout features have been implemented to improve the ergonomics of the website.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Max width of <code>#main-content</code></strong>: The maximum width of the main content container
            has been set to
            <code>960px</code>. Without this restraint, text would expand across the entire screen, making it harder to
            read.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Responsive HTML</strong>: Through the use of media queries, the website can adapt to different
            screen sizes, such
            as the alternation between <code>column</code> and <code>row</code> flexbox layouts.</li>
          <li><strong>Padding</strong>: Almost every element has some amount of padding to make it distinguishable. This
            approach prevents a crammed website design.</li>
          <li><strong>Margins</strong>: Margins are used to centre the main content and add spacing between headings to
            reflect their hierarchy and importance.</li>
          <li><strong>Interactivity</strong>: Navbar buttons change colour depending on their state (using CSS
            pseudo-selectors like <code>active</code> and <code>focus</code>). Furthermore, the navbar buttons also
            indicate which page is active through bolded text.</li>
          <li><strong>Use of the <code>&lt;code&gt;</code> element</strong>: Placing content that refers to HTML, CSS,
            or computer science related concepts in code tags helps support the key ideas of the comment page, while
            also making it easier for the reader to understand the primary concepts that are being discussed.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3><span class="text-accent">Accessibility and Ergonomics</span></h3>
        <p>The <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/" target="_blank">Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a> was adhered to
          when developing the website, to accomodate for a wide range of end-users. Thorough consideration was also
          given to various other design aspects to improve ergonomics.</p>
        <h4>Consideration of screen readers</h4>
        <p>All images used in the website have a defined <code>alt</code> attribute, which describes the content of the
          image. This is a vital design consideration for screen readers (often used by visually impaired users), as
          the <code>alt</code> property takes the place of the image. </p>
        <h4>Compatibility with smaller devices</h4>
        <figure class="aside">
          <img class="responsive-image" src="images/responsive.png" width="300"
            alt="A picture from this site containing a header with a nav and title, as well as some text content, using the dimensions of the iPhone 12.">
          <figcaption>The layout of this page on a phone.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>To ensure the website could be viewed on smaller devices, Firefox's <a
            href="https://firefox-source-docs.mozilla.org/devtools-user/responsive_design_mode/"
            target="_blank">Responsive Design Mode</a> feature was utilised. The website was tested on a variety of
          dimensions to ensure it was legible and still looked good.</p>
        <h4>Font sizing, spacing and selection</h4>
        <p>The font size was reduced from 16 pixels to 15.5 pixels, which suited the design of the website better. Line
          height was increased to <code>1.6rem</code> to improve readability. The use of the <code>rem</code> unit is
          vital in this case, as it allows the line spacing to scale with the root font size (what <code>rem</code>)
          refers to.</p>
        <h4>Semantic Elements</h4>
        <p>While most HTML elements carry little to no semantic value, such as the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element,
          some elements such as <code>&lt;h1...h6&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;aside&gt;</code> carry more meaning. One such
          example is to compare the <code>&lt;b&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;strong&gt;</code> elements. The former simply
          denotes text that is stylised as bold. The latter denotes text that is important to the context it is placed
          in. Semantic elements such as these gives the website a meaningful structure while also helping screen readers
          distinguish what part of the page the user is in (a benefit that relates more to semantic elements like
          <code>&lt;main&gt;</code>).

        <h4>Anchors</h4>
        <p>All anchors have the <code>target</code> attribute set to <code>_blank</code>, which makes the anchor's url
          open in a new tab. It can be annoying when interacting with an anchor overrides the current tab's webpage, so
          this feature improves the website's ergonomics and useability.</p>
        <h4>No style appearance</h4>
        <p>When disabling styles, the website renders well enough that the content can be read and distinguished. One
          issue was images being too large, so, instead of changing their resolution, the <code>width</code> attribute
          of the <code>&lt;img&gt;</code> element was set to an integer between 300-600, depending on the image's aspect
          ratio, to prevent it from exceeding the size of the page. The website's ability to be read and understood
          without CSS accomodates for some screen readers or viewers who prefer CSS off.</p>
